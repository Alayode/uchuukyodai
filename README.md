This Repo is just dedicated to my learning and experimenting with different web technologies and also my 
blog drafts. I would like to one day when I get around to it create a website for my blog from scratch in 
CFML/SQL/AngularJS. 

Today we'll be creating a simple Laravel authentication. Using migrations, seeding, routes, controllers and views, we'll
walk through the entire process.

    - Creating  a users tablee using migrations
    - Filling our new users with sample users using seeding
    - Using the command line tool to migrate and seed
    - Creating a login form and processing a login using routes, controllers and views
    - Handling login errors
    - Use Eloquent ORM  to validate  a user
